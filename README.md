## The Work

#### Backend Built: 

- Bcryptjs 
    - [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- sqlite 
    - [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)
- Knex
    - [knex](https://github.com/tgriesser/knex)
- Express
    - [express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
- Heroku
    - [http://www.heroku.com](http://www.heroku.com)

#### So Why Did We Chose These Stack 

##### Heroku 
- Heroku intergrates with Github so it provides continious deployment, if needed.

##### Express-Node 
- Reliable documentation, good performace within the project.

### Testing 

Testing of this application was completed through many stages of development when bieng build using termincal logging and Postman.

Testing was done by both contributors within  the develpment of this application by each contributor submitting a pull request to the masterbranch and after each merge all elements were working together properly.

The application was set up to continously deploy to Heroku. To make sure it continously deploys, our master branch was automatcally checked upon every pull request to make sure the new code would not break the build.

### Install Like This 

#### Using The Application 

Requirements: 
- Node 
- Package Manager (such as Yarn or npm)

1. [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
2. [ ] Clone your forked version of the Repository.
3. [ ] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `firstName-lastName`.
4. [ ] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.
5. [ ] Push commits: git push origin `firstName-lastName`
6. Open terminal and `cd` into the server folder and run `yarn install` to install the neccessary node_modules on the backend.

* #### Database in Development

    - #### Development 
        - Development database setup:
            ```

            development: {
                client: 'sqlite3',
                useNullAsDefault: true,
                connection: {
                filename: './database/celeb.db3'
                },
                pool: {
                afterCreate: (conn, done) => {
                conn.run('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON', done);
                }
                },
                migrations: { directory: './database/migrations'},
                seeds: { directory: './database/seeds'}
            }, 
            ```

    - #### Data Models

        - #### Users Table 
            * The ‘users’ table stores the profile of the user. Once thats done, a users row will be created once the ‘Log In’ line is put in for saved results.

            ```js

            return knex.schema.createTable('users', users => {
                users.increments(); // primary key 

                users.string('username', 128).unique(); // username field
                users.string('password', 128).notNullable(); // password field
                users.string('email', 256).unique(); // email field 
    })
    ```

                celebs.increments(); // 
                celebs.string('celebs_name', 128);
                celebs
                .integer('celebs_age')
                .unsigned()
